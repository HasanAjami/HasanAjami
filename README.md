Hi,
I will be posting various code examples and solutions from different exercises.
If you have any questions or need help, you can always contact me via email: hasan.ajami2002@gmail.com
The codes are from some students I have had from German universities, therefore, the questions and soloutions are in German. I might post translations, but I don't think anybody is interested :)
